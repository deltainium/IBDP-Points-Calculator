# **The Unofficial IB Diploma Program Points Calculator**

A quick and comprihensive way to calculate your IB Diploma points all in one package.

## **Warning**:
I'm just a guy with a computer. Though I consider my program to work as intended, I may have entirely misunderstood the algorithm the IB uses to calculate their diploma scores.
### Linux
Open a terminal instance and run:
```zsh
git clone "https://github.com/deltainium/IBDP-Points-Calculator"
cd IBDP-Points-Calculator/
python calculator.py
```
