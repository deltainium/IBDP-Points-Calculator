# **The Unofficial IB Diploma Program Points Calculator**

A quick and comprihensive way to calculate your IB Diploma points all in one package.

## **Warning**:
I'm just a guy with a computer. Though I consider my program to work as intended, I may have entirely misunderstood the algorithm the IB uses to calculate their diploma scores.
**Please avoid using this project for anything remotely important.** If you need your diploma score for university and whatnot your best bet would be to consult a teacher or counselor.

## **Usage**
Naturally for both Windows and Linux a semi-recent version of [Python](https://www.python.org/) is required.
### Windows
Download "calculator.py", navigate to wherever it's saved through your file explorer, and double click like any other program.
### Linux
#### Bin Install
Download the [latest bin file](https://github.com/deltainium/IBDP-Points-Calculator/releases/) from the repository's releases, navigate to your download location in a terminal, and open the file with ```zsh ./IBDP-Points-Calculator```.
If your terminal prints and error ensure the file has permission to be executed with ```zsh sudo chmod +x IBDP-Points-Calculator```
#### Source code install
Open a terminal instance and run:
```zsh
git clone "https://github.com/deltainium/IBDP-Points-Calculator"
cd IBDP-Points-Calculator/
python calculator.py
```
